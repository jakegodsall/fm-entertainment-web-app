## Overview

This is my solution for the [Entertainment web app](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/entertainment-web-app-J-UhgAW1X) challenge from Frontend Mentor. The project is built using React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. Additionally, a supplementary backend has been developed using Spring Boot, which can be found [here](https://github.com/jakegodsall/fm-entertainment-web-app-backend).
