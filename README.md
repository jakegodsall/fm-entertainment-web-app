# Entertainment Web App (Frontend Mentor)

## Overview
This repository houses the complete solution for the Entertainment web app challenge from Frontend Mentor. The project is split into two main components: a frontend built with React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, and a backend developed using Spring Boot. This setup provides a full-stack application experience, from a dynamic and responsive user interface to robust backend services.

## Structure

### Frontend

The frontend directory contains the user interface of the web app. It's built using modern web technologies for an engaging user experience. For more details, refer to the frontend README.

### Backend
